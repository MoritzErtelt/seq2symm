Datasets used to train the models

  1.  the homo-oligomer data with the labels and protein sequences and the train/test splits file

  2.  the denovo and UniFold evaluation datasets are in the Supplementary material
  
  3.  the predictions from the model on various datasets, predictions on proteomes
