Datasets used to train the models

  1.  the homo-oligomer data with the labels and protein sequences
  2.  the train/test splits file
  3.  the denovo and UniFold evaluation datasets are in the Supplementary material
  4.  the predictions from the model on various datasets, predictions on proteomes are available as part of Supplementary material on Nature Communications
  5.  two trained models: one with and one without distillation
  6.  links to the proteome files are below:
