Datasets used to train the models

  1.  The homo-oligomer PDB ids with the labels were downloaded from the PDB: https://www.rcsb.org/ 
      This labeled data and the train/val/test splits can be downloaded here: 
        http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/seq2symm/datasets.zip

      The protein sequences corresponding to the PDB ids in homo-oligomer dataset can be obtained from: https://www.rcsb.org/
  
  2.  The denovo and UniFold evaluation datasets are from prior published work and listed in the Supplementary material. The links to the publications from where these datasets were downloaded are below:
      UniFold manuscript: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.30.505833v1
      Publications from which the denovo data was obtained:
